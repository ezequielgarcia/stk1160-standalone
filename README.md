IMPORTANT
=========

    Somewhat deprecated, this driver is.
                                (Yoda)

I'm pleased to announce that stk1160 is fully mainlined since Linux v3.7.

The driver you are looking at is for Linux v3.4 **only**.

This version works fine. If you find any problems, keep in
mind this version is no longer under maintainance.

Please use a recent kernel (>= v3.7) whenever possible.

stk1160-standalone
==================

stk1160 release 0.9.3\_for\_v3.4

This driver is specially made for you: the user;
so anything you think it's not clear enough, please open an github issue.

This is the stk1160 driver (formerly known as easycap driver).
It's the driver needed to capture audio and video in some of those
little devices named as Easycap (if they are based on stk1160 chip).

You need to have this modules installed, but don't worry,
you don't have to insert them manually:

- snd\_usb\_audio
- snd\_ac97\_codec
- ac97\_bus
- saa7115
- videodev
- videobuf2\_core
- videobuf2\_vmalloc
- videobuf2\_memops
- v4l2\_common

Building and installing
-----------------------

    make
    make install
    
After this, perhaps you will have to run 'depmod -a'.

Usage
-----

After installing the driver you're ready to go.
If you now insert your usb easycap device you'll notice two modules get automatically loaded:
stk1160 and snd-usb-audio.
This can be seen using dmesg:

    $ dmesg | grep registered
    [48.561592] stk1160 2-2:1.0: V4L2 device registered as video0
    [48.562284] usbcore: registered new interface driver stk1160
    [49.169189] usbcore: registered new interface driver snd-usb-audio

Also, stk1160 will register a control-only alsa sound card.
This sound card is called 'stk1160-mixer'.
To enable sound capture you have to open alsamixer and selected
the 'Line' item on the capture menu for stk1160-mixer device.

This stk1160-mixer device is needed because snd-usb-audio
doesn't show mixer controls for the ac97 codec chip.
The real usb transfer for audio capture is done through snd-usb-audio.

Preventing old easycap driver from loading
------------------------------------------

If you want to prevent some module from loading
you can do so by adding it to blacklist file.

On many distributions this can be done like this:

    echo "blacklist easycap" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

This way easycap won't be loaded automatically by udev;
you can still load it manually, of course.
